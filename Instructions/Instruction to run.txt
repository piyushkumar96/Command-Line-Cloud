Steps to run project:

1.As the project contains large no. of modules. So first copy these modules to that folder where all by 
  default modules of python are stored like in linux "/usr/lib64/python2.7/"

2. Your Server Ip should be 192.168.1.3 If not then set ip using ifconfig command otherwise project will not 	work and port no 1996 should be free.

3. After that Run the File  MainCloudMenu.py on Server using command "python2 MainCloudMenu.py".

4. On Client side Run the File USER_MANNUAL.py using command "python2 USER_MANNUAL.py".

5. At same time More number of  instance of clients can connect to Single Instance of Server but just change 	port address in clients file "USER_MANNUAL.py" for different users.
